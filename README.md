## Description
Mahafil is a booking platform for wedding halls, offices, and coworking spaces in Saudi Arabia. It provides a single system where users can search, compare, and book venues easily, while venue owners can manage listings and reservations digitally.
Currently, most venue bookings in Saudi Arabia are handled through phone calls or social media, with no unified platform. This results in unclear availability, inconsistent pricing, and inefficient booking processes. Venue owners also depend on manual management, which increases the risk of double bookings and lost customers.

## Anticipated Deliverables
- Source code submitted through a GitHub repository
